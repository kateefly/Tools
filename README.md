## Contributing via this GitHub Repository

This is a group effort and we welcome any and all contributions. This information below includes the basics to get you started with making change requests directly to this repository. If you get stuck, please contact a group member. We'd love to improve the documentation to make it easier for everyone to contribute.

## Practices for Contributing to this Repository

**Setting up a new child site repository**

1. Select the Import Repository Option from the Github site
2. You will be taken to a page that lets you create a new repository based on an existing one. Make sure the owner of the new repository is DLFMetadataAssessment. For the text box titled "Your old repository's clone URL" input ```https://github.com/DLFMetadataAssessment/EnvironmentalScan.git```. This is the URL for the EnvironmentalScan child repository.
3. Delete the content of the entries folder. You will repopulate this folder with content of your new child repository.
4. Modify ReadMe.md as needed to describe your new child repository.
5. Modify Index.md as needed to describe your new child repository.
6. Modify includes/nav.html. You will need to remove the links to the Environmental Scan child repository and add links to your new repository and any new content in the entries folder. Your new repository can be linked as the root page ```/```. Put any pages in the entries folder you create in an unordered list under the link to your new repository. The links to these will follow the format ```/entries/filename.html``` where "filename" is the file name of the page you are linking to.

**Branch Names**

Once an issue is raised in our GitHub repository, we create a branch with a name based on the issue number it is addressing, i.e. 'issue#1'. The pull request generated to fix Issue 1 is then the merging of that branch into the **master** branch, which feeds into the Github.io website.

You can see and comment on a list of [outstanding issues](https://github.com/DLFMetadataAssessment/DLFMetadataAssessment.github.io/issues).

The examples and walk through of GitHub and Jekyll below uses "issue#3" as a subject. That's the branch name used in the commit message.

**Pull Requests**

Once you have committed your changes to your branch for a particular issue, submit a pull request to have your changes reviewed. It will be merged by another member of the group. We request that nobody merges their own pull requests.

If your pull request sits for a while, you can submit an email to the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dlf-aig-metadata-assessment-working-group) asking for it to be reviewed.
